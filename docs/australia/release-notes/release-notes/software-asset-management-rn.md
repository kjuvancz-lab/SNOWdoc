See [Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/c_SoftwareAssetMgmt.md) for more information.

**Important:** Software Asset Management is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Manage IBM sub-capacity licensing on Nutanix AHV \(Acropolis Hypervisor\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/ibm-licensing-vmware-vsphere-environment.md)**

    Gain visibility into IBM products deployed on Nutanix AHV virtualized environments, with consumption data for sub-capacity eligible metrics such as PVU, VPC, and RVU MAPC \(Managed Activated Processor Cores\). Licensing calculations align with IBM sub-capacity requirements, including 30-minute capacity scans that capture peak processor core capacity to help keep license positions audit-ready.

    **Note:** IBM sub-capacity licensing on Nutanix AHV is available with IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management 7.0.0 and later versions.

-   **[Gain visibility into the software asset life cycle with improved CMDB data quality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cmdb-sa-sam-use.md)**

    Audit your Software Asset Management CMDB for data quality gaps including missing edition/version details, cloud license inconsistencies, duplicate installs, and misaligned virtual-to-host relationships. Use the CMDB success advisor for Software Asset Management to systematically validate CI attributes, remediate duplicates, and establish consistent server mapping rules across your estate.


-   **[Streamline entitlement import by resolving import errors with AI-suggested corrections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/resolve-entitlement-import-error.md)**

    Reduce manual effort and improve data accuracy when reviewing entitlement import errors in the Software Asset Workspace by using AI skills. When publisher or product names in the standard entitlement import template don't match standard content, the Software normalization and Product match reviewer skills provide AI-suggested corrections for review. The feature also identifies potential duplicate entitlements, enabling you to review and dismiss them where appropriate.

-   **[Enhance SaaS application usage monitoring by integrating with the Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/shadow-saas-analytics.md)**

    Monitor SaaS application usage across your organization by using URL monitoring data through the integration of your Software Asset Management application with ACC-VC. The SaaS Detection Report aggregates this usage data and distinguishes managed applications from the unmanaged ones. This enhancement provides actionable visibility to ServiceNow Otto for SAM managers into actual SaaS usage for software spend optimization.

    **Note:** The ACC-VC integration with the Software Asset Management application is available with Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management 17.4.0 and later versions.

## Changed in this release

-   **[Now Assist &gt; ServiceNow Otto announcement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/platform-now-assist-landing.md)**

    Now Assist introduced AI on the platform. As that experience has evolved, there's a new name for the experience. ServiceNow Otto® is the conversational AI platform integrated into ServiceNow workflows. It provides agentic capabilities, supports multimodal interactions across web, mobile, and messaging channels, and enables autonomous orchestration for cross-system workflows.


-   **[Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md)**
