# Build Agent release notes

The ServiceNow® Build Agent application enables developers to create, edit, and deploy full-stack applications and metadata through a conversational interface. Build Agent was enhanced and updated in the Australia release, and its Now Assist features have been rebranded to ServiceNow Otto®.

## Build Agent highlights for the Australia release

-   Use Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio.
-   Work with additional Model Context Protocol \(MCP\) support.
-   Create apps and newly supported metadata in the global scope.
-   Choose from newly supported models.
-   Search external content without leaving Build Agent.

See [Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Automatic test maintenance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md)**

    Test Agent in Build Agent automatically updates or removes Automated Test Framework tests that are outdated as your application changes, keeping the test suite aligned with the current state of your code. UI tests don't run automatically during updates, because they can take additional time and interrupt the development flow. To automatically keep tests synced, you must enable the new **Sync ATF tests with app** setting in Build Agent.

-   **[UI testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md)**

    Generate comprehensive UI tests for applications you build with Build Agent. UI testing extends the existing functional test capability to cover browser-level interactions, such as multi-step page navigation flows. To run UI tests automatically on update, you must enable the **Run UI ATF tests** setting in Test Agent.

    **Note:** You can also prompt Build Agent to generate UI tests.

-   **[Get prompted to test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md)**

    After each development action, Build Agent can prompt you to generate ATF tests for what you just built. Accept or decline the prompt at each step to keep test coverage in sync with your development work.

    **Note:** You must enable getting prompted to test in the Build Agent settings.

-   **[SDK test execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md)**

    Execute ATF tests from the ServiceNow SDK. Test execution and troubleshooting were previously available only in ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow IDE.

-   **[Updated model support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-models-versions.md)**

    The following new models are supported for Build Agent:

    -   Gemini 3.5 is now the default model for Google
    -   GPT 5.5 is now the default model for Azure OpenAI
    -   Opus 4.8
-   **[Change model version in chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-models-versions.md)**

    Change the AI model versions in Build Agent without navigating out to the table on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

-   **[Define custom skills and rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-configure-custom-skills-rules.md)**

    Create custom skills and rules to control how Build Agent behaves during a session.

    -   Custom rules are injected into the system prompt on every run, so Build Agent behaves consistently at the scope you choose.
    -   Custom skills provide internal guidelines for specific tasks. You can apply skills and rules at the instance level, application level, or user level.
-   **[Background script execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-tools.md)**

    Run server-side scripts as part of app-building flows in Build Agent using the new run script and rollback script tools. Before a script runs, an approval prompt shows the generated script, its stated intent, and the target application scope so you can review the operation before approving.

-   **[Conversation handoff to Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/access-build-agent.md)**

    Build applications by receiving context from ServiceNow Otto \(formerly Now Assist\) conversations and continuing work in Build Agent without repeating yourself. The full conversation transcript is attached to the session so you can reference details beyond the summary. Conversation handoff is available only in ServiceNow Studio.

-   **[Use Build Agent in a sandbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/access-build-agent.md)**

    Use Build Agent in Developer Sandboxes to isolate development and provide admin access to developers in a protected environment.

-   **[View MCP tools per server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/accelerate-design-to-development-with-figma-mcp-server.md)**

    View the list of tools available on each connected MCP server in the Build Agent settings panel.

-   **[Knowledge base access metadata support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md)**

    Work with the knowledge base access metadata type in Build Agent.


-   **[Web search tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-tools.md)**

    Access public web content from Build Agent using two new search tools. Use the web search tool to find information on the public web, and use the web fetch tool to retrieve content from a URL that you supply.

-   **[Consolidated update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-update-sets.md)**

    Track changes generated by Build Agent and manual edits in update sets for checkpointing and rollback. Update sets can be merged into a single update set before deployment. All changes to your application are captured in the same scope, making it easier to review what was modified and merge updates to other environments.

-   **[Expanded metadata support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md)**

    Work with more metadata types in Build Agent, which now supports connection and credential alias, data lookup, playbooks, rest message/HTTP method, and user criteria.


-   **[MCP server support in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-connct-mcp-server.md)**

    Connect Build Agent to external MCP servers in ServiceNow Studio. Previously, MCP server connectivity was only available in the ServiceNow IDE.

-   **[Additional MCP server integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/accelerate-design-to-development-with-figma-mcp-server.md)**

    Integrate Build Agent with newly supported MCP servers.

-   **[Access update sets from Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-update-sets.md)**

    View update sets created by Build Agent from within the chat panel in ServiceNow Studio. Each checkpoint includes a button that opens the relevant update set in a new tab.

-   **[UI validation tool in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-tools.md)**

    Validate user interface output during app creation with the UI validation tool in Build Agent, available in ServiceNow Studio.

-   **[Search retrieval tool support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-about-creating-in-app-agents.md)**

    Use the Search retrieval tool to enable agents to fetch and present relevant information from configured data sources in response to user queries. Agents can retrieve knowledge articles, catalog items, and other indexed content directly within the agentic workflow, reducing the need for users to navigate to separate search interfaces.

-   **[Support for more file types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-supported-file-types.md)**

    Upload more types of files to Build Agent to describe what you want to build, including images, documents, and text and code files.

-   **[Expanded metadata support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md)**

    Work with more metadata types in Build Agent, which now supports assignment rules, forms, and data policies.


-   **[MCP Client integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-connct-mcp-server.md)**

    Connect Build Agent to external MCP servers to bring tools and data sources directly into your build workflow. External resources participate alongside Build Agent on the ServiceNow AI Platform, which reduces the need to switch between tools and transfer data manually.

-   **[Create agentic workflows, agents, and skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/create-custom-ai-agent.md)**

    Turn business requirements into fully configured agents, skills, and agentic workflows for your custom applications. Build Agent inspects the existing tables, roles, business rules, and metadata in your app to create tailored in-app agents and tools.

-   **[Test Agent for Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md)**

    Use Test Agent to execute Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) tests right from the Build Agent chat panel for test artifacts created in the same session. When tests fail, the generated tests and test results are saved in the standard ATF record tables and can be scheduled for continued regression testing for the app. If Test Agent modifies tests during troubleshooting, those changes are automatically saved to the test records.

-   **[UI validation tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/exploring-build-agent.md)**

    Validate user interface output during Build Agent app creation in the ServiceNow IDE using the integrated UI validation. UI validation runs Playwright-based UI checks on Cloud Runner and surfaces failures with diagnostic context directly in the Build Agent panel.

-   **[Semantic search for instance artifact discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-tools.md)**

    Use semantic search in Build Agent to locate relevant instance artifacts, including tables, scripts, and business rules during build and edit tasks. Find files, applications, and knowledge on your instance based on meaning instead of exact keywords.

-   **[Additional model support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/exploring-build-agent.md)**

    Choose the provider and model that fits your organizational needs in Build Agent, which now supports Anthropic Claude on AWS Sonnet 4.6 and Azure OpenAI GPT 5.4.

-   **[Expanded metadata support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md)**

    Work with more metadata types in Build Agent, which now supports flows, Service Catalog configurations, inbound email actions, dictionary overrides, choice lists, condition builder query conditions, and enhanced Service Portal capabilities.

-   **[Contextual launch for Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/access-build-agent.md)**

    Include context from ServiceNow Studio tabs and component preview screens when you open Build Agent. Context helps reduce the need to manually search for and specify context in the chat panel.


-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

-   **[Improved checkpoint and update set management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-conversational-change-log.md)**

    Build Agent handles checkpoints and update sets differently in the following ways:

    -   Checkpoint 0 no longer creates an update set.
    -   Checkpoint 1 is the base update set for all subsequent changes.
    -   Update sets use human-readable naming.
-   **[Enhanced semantic metadata search tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-tools.md)**

    An updated semantic metadata search tool improves performance replaces the previous semantic search tool.
