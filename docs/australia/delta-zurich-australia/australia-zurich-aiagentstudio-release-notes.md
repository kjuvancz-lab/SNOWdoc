The glide.ai\_record\_activity.validation.feature.enabled system property enables UI rule validation \(such as required fields\) for AI‑initiated record updates. You can selectively apply this validation based on execution context using additional system properties. For example, glide.ai\_record\_activity.ai\_detection.nap.enabled applies validation to record updates triggered from the ServiceNow Otto panel. Similar properties control validation for AI skills, Virtual Agent, and agent‑initiated actions, as listed in the [Reference for Now Assist AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-aia-reference&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). This feature is opt‑in and disabled by default.

-   **[Agentic evaluation offer issue tracing and suggested optimizations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=agentic-evals&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

After an automated evaluation of an agentic AI asset, you can receive a list of issues and suggested optimizations to address those issues. Issues come with individual record node-by-node traces to pinpoint the exact source of problems. Optimizations are suggested, and you can apply them and run a reevaluation from a single guided flow.


-   **[Updates to platform agentic workflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=platform-use-cases&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

[Process images for new tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=images-tasks&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) now links to the created task record upon creation and includes certain metadata from the image.


-   **[Changes to AI usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Australia Early Access, AI usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: AI Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).


-   **[Request status AI agent](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ticket-status-aia&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The request status AI agent provides an AI-generated summary of the most recent comments from the AI agent or other people working on a ticket. You can add attachments to an open ticket or incident to support a request action. To find more information about an open ticket, you can ask the request status AI agent follow-up questions based on previous answers from the agent.

-   **[Confirm your web search tool provider data policies](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-web-search-ai-agent&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you select Google as your web search provider for web search AI agent tools, Google uses [Grounding with Google Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/grounding-with-google-search), offered under a Global Standard deployment, and data may be routed to places outside of regions specified on your ServiceNow AI Platform instance as a result. Consult your organization's data policies before enabling AI agents with web search tools that use Google as the provider.


-   **[Add version control to instructions sent to the LLM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=version-control&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can review multiple versions of instructions sent to the LLM when designing your AI agents or agentic workflows. You can choose which version is active to help with testing or evaluating the success of an AI agent or agentic workflow to compare against other versions. Versions are named and ordered by time created for organizational purposes.

-   **[Duplicate and edit existing tools when creating new AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-tool-aia&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Issues come with individual record node-by-node traces to pinpoint the exact source of problems. Optimizations are suggested, and you can apply them and run a reevaluation from a single guided flow.
