# Exploring the CSDM model

The CSDM is the data model that admins should follow when they set up ServiceNow products and applications. The standards for defining configuration items \(CIs\) and relationships between CIs in the CMDB helps to promote that your data resides in the appropriate CMDB tables. The result is maximum value from ServiceNow AI Platform applications.

## Definitions of CSDM terms

See [CSDM terms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/servicenow-platform/common-service-data-model-csdm/csdm-term-definitions.md).

## Goal of CSDM

Following the CSDM data model helps you to accurately and completely capture the data objects that help you to run your business.

CSDM provides guidance on where to put data in the platform. Because there are multiple ways of identifying and using data, the CSDM guidelines help you to determine the best data structures for supporting your organization's services.

## How tables in CSDM data domains support the service life cycle

\[Omitted image "csdm-service-life-cycle-flow.png"\] Alt text: CSDM domains support service life cycles.

1.  When you first start working on an instance, your admins install and populate the CMDB data structures. The data is required to enable your platform features and capabilities. This kind of data is kept in tables that are considered foundational to all products on your instance. We therefore refer to this set of tables as forming the Foundation domain — it supports all of the other data domains.
2.  You start with an idea — an idea that implements your business model. The idea or concept is saved in data that you work on in the tables of the **Ideation &amp; Strategy** domain.
3.  If your research determines that the idea has merit, you can decide to commit to it and move forward into designing and planning the idea. You might design the products to implement the idea internally or buy something to integrate into your organization's offerings. The supporting data lives in tables in the **Design &amp; Planning** domain.
4.  After the design is complete and acceptable, you can hand it off to the teams that will build or integrate the idea. Designers and developers build the software that implements the idea. The supporting data lives in tables in the **Build &amp; Integration** domain. Information learned in this stage of the product life cycle is fed back into data in the domains that were involved earlier in the digital product's life cycle.
5.  You can now release the idea. It's delivered from the infrastructure and management of the **Service Delivery** domain to the catalog of business offerings in the **Service Consumption** domain so that your customers can consume it. Customers can be internal or external. Again, information learned in these stages is fed back.

    The Manage Portfolio domain is a layer on top of the CSDM conceptual model that interacts with the other CSDM domains. The typical user, a service owner, might be responsible for services in more than one domain.


## Roles that create, maintain, and use the data

**Note:** The Application Owner, Portfolio Manager \(multiple\), and Service Owner \(multiple\) might be the same persons.

    -   Maintain the accuracy and integrity of the CMDB
    -   Work with various SMEs to certify that the data is accurate and aligned to the data model
    -   Create new Cls and own the SACM processes
