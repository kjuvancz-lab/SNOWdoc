-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key bundle-grc.configure-criticality-factors\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-criticality-factors&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Leverage criticality factors to evaluate the initial risks associated with processing activities. Integrate these factors into privacy assessments and automatically generate a criticality score upon assessment approval. These factors are also added to processing activities, enabling you to make updates at any time. Integrating these factors in a privacy assessment eliminates the need for a separate criticality assessment. This consolidation reduces the workload for the privacy teams.

-   **[Smart assessments](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=smart-assessments-in-privacy-management&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new and improved assessment experience that enables:

    -   capturing the data elements, the information object attributes, hierarchies
    -   building the assessment questionnaire
This new experience enables responders to update all the necessary details within the assessments, eliminating the need to update the processing activity separately.

-   **[Configure categories](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-information-object-categories&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Implement Information object categories to tag and classify information objects effectively. For example, attributes like iris scans and fingerprints are often referred to as biometric data, or email addresses and phone numbers can be tagged as contact information. Information object categories enable you to categorize these information objects under these broader classifications. This approach is useful in the following ways:

    -   Enhances compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and so on by accurately capturing and tracking required data categories.
    -   Improves clarity for business users, ensuring they can easily identify and work with terms they’re familiar with while adhering to regulatory standards.
    -   Streamlines data governance by creating a structured framework that supports both regulatory needs and business operations.
-   **[Smart assessment for privacy case management action tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=accept-a-case-task&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new assessment experience of Smart Assessment Engine for privacy case action tasks. Only when an action task moves from the **Draft** to the **Assigned** state, the assessment can be sent. To use the smart assessment, a new property called enable\_smart\_assessments \(sn\_grc\_case\_mgmt.enable\_smart\_assessments\) is introduced with the default value as **true**.

-   **[Data subjects](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-subjects&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Select and define the multiple data subject types for each processing activity. You can capture the volume of data subjects that were processed, the specific data elements that were collected from the users, and the user locations. With this feature, you get a realistic, granular, and scalable representation of your processing activities.

-   **[Privacy management dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=privacy-manager-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get an overview of your complete privacy risk and compliance posture from the Privacy Management dashboard so that you can quickly prioritize and remediate your processing activities. By looking at the Processing Activities, Risk &amp; Compliance, and Operations &amp; Case management sections, you can see the overall compliance score, trends, privacy criticality assessment scores, and risk heatmap. From the dashboard, you can also see information about the global legal framework to understand the regional obligations and the built-in risk metrics that automatically assess each processing activity.

-   **[New screening and PIA templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=privacy-mgmt-workflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new Privacy Impact Assessments \(PIAs\) and Screening Assessment templates that provide standardized questions, evaluation criteria, and workflows so that you can perform a processing activity criticality and privacy risk assessment. With these new templates, you can ensure consistency, reduce manual effort, and support compliance with regulatory and organizational requirements.
