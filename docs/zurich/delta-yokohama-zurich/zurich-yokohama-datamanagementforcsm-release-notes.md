Use the new CSM Data Classification \(com.snc.csm\_data\_privacy\) Store app that delivers base system classifications for CRM data, categorizing it as internal, personally identifiable information \(PII\), confidential, and more.

Synchronize only specific sections of your data structure using the new partial sync capability in the create instance flow. This enhancement introduces the `allowedContextTypes` parameter, which enables you to specify exactly which types should be processed during synchronization operations. This leads to the following benefits:

    -   Improved performance: Reduction in processing time for targeted updates.
