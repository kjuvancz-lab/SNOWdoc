Yokohama

</td><td>

-   Upgrading to Yokohama may extend the upgrade maintenance time of a customer due to Appointment Booking. The Appointment Booking configuration tables get extended to the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table as a part of the upgrade. After upgrading to Yokohama, re-parenting occurs automatically and the duration of the re-parenting depends on the number of records in Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table.
-   Effective March 1, 2025, Google has designated the Places API, Directions API, and Distance Matrix API as Legacy services. The newer versions of these services are Places API \(New\) and Routes API. You can’t enable or generate new API keys for these legacy services. However, you can continue using these services with the existing API keys. If you need to create a new Google API key after March 1, 2025, you must enable the new APIs from Google Console and upgrade to Yokohama Patch 3 version or higher to ensure compatibility.

-   **[Using Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-dispatcher-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Dispatcher Workspace to perform the following tasks:

    -   Use the advanced resource filter to sort contractors and equipment.
    -   Add agents to Dispatcher Workspace to see their schedules, or assign them tasks if you manage the assignment group or territory they're a part of. This action can be done without loading the entire assignment group or territory that the agent is a member of.
    -   Set up the calendar to use multiple time zones at once. For more information, see [Show multiple time zones](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-stacked-time-zones&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Navigate from a work order task to a related list of smart assessments that are associated with that work order.
-   **[Assigning WOTs manually](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DispatchWorkOrderTasks&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the records page to perform the following tasks that was limited to Dispatcher Workspace before:

    -   Flag a work order task.
    -   Use assignment assistance.
-   **[Schedule Optimization](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=schedule-optimization-engine&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Schedule Optimization to do the following:

    -   Initiate immediate optimization to adjust schedules and tasks when an in-day event occurs, like a new priority 1 task, a canceled task, an agent taking PTO, or an agent running late.
    -   Assign the best agent for a work order task based on agent efficiency, which helps schedule and assign tasks more appropriately, using Field Service Agent Efficiency.
    -   Define work, travel, and overtime penalty values for each agent so the optimization engine can either schedule a nearby agent with a higher penalty or a distant agent with a lower penalty.

    -   Improve task scheduling by assigning dependent tasks to a single technician within the same shift.
-   **[Workforce](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-workforce&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable managers to show or hide work order tasks from the **Calendars** tab in Workforce. When Workforce Optimization for Field Service is enabled, these tasks can also be viewed in Hybrid and Map views.

-   **[Field Service Scheduling](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=setting-up-scheduling-methods&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage resource attributes for any duration, whether a single day or multiple days.

-   **[Appointment Booking](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=appointment-booking-administer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Appointment Booking to do the following:

    -   Enable better control over task sequencing using new dependency types, such as 'Finish to Start - Same Day' and 'Finish Together' with lag options, integrated with appointment booking for more precise scheduling. Enhance operational insight for all roles through improved visualizations including dependency trees, conflict alerts, and task indicators, which support dispatcher decisions and technician execution.
    -   Optimize appointment recommendations by allowing radius configuration at the territory level, tailored to diverse areas, such as urban versus rural. This capability includes an extension point for customers to implement custom radius logic with default instance-level values if no specific configuration is set.
    -   Enhance appointment recommendations by allowing grading against user-defined similar services rather than identical ones, resulting in more versatile scheduling options. This feature includes an extension point for customers to specify which services they consider similar, and the system defaults to same-catalog matching if no custom configuration is provided.
    -   Increase scheduling flexibility with new features to support slot overlap and overrides. This capability enables territory-based customization of appointment windows, default schedules, and specific slot-level overrides, giving more control over availability.

-   **[SLAs in Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-dispatcher-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The SLAs breached query on the Dispatcher Dashboard in Dispatcher Workspace has been updated to look at the SLAs that are associated with the work order tasks only instead of the work orders and work order tasks. The SLA breached counter on the task cards is also static, instead of real time. For more information on changing the SLA timer on task cards, see the Enable the **SLA timer on work order task cards** property on [Configure settings for Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-workspce-settings&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Assignment groups and territories in Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-dispatcher-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

You must save the default assignment groups or territories in Dispatcher Workspace to load when you open Dispatcher Workspace. If you don’t have the defaults saved, then you must select the assignment groups or territories to appear every time you open Dispatcher Workspace. This change is made to improve the performance of Dispatcher Workspace. For more information on saving the default assignment groups, see the Groups section on the **General** tab on [Enable Dispatcher Workspace settings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispatcher-wrkspc-settings&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). For information on saving default territories, see [Select Territories in Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=select-territory-dispatch&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Administrators can disable this by setting the **sn\_fsm\_disp\_wrkspc.enableEmptyState** system property to false.
