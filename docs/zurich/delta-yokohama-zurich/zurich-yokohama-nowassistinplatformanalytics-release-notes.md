Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[View recommended actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=expl-view-recommended-actions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

AI Data Explorer can suggest actions based on the insights that it generates in an exploration.

-   **[Ask questions about FX currency data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=qg-supported-query-operations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Query Generation now supports the FXCurrency \(Currency 2\) data type. This means that you can use AI Data Explorer to explore financial operations data, including those within Source-to-Pay Operations.

-   **[Benefit from improvements to segments](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=querygen-segments&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Segments are reusable definitions in Query Generation that provide non-obvious context to assist the semantic layer or LLM to select the correct dimension and values. Users can create manual segments via a new form. A scheduled job synchronizes manual and autogenerated segments. This job also cleans up segments to help surface the correct segments and reduce noise.

Domain separation is also now supported, with a Domain field on the Segments table. Segments based on reports and filters inherit the source domain. Manual segments have domains that are passed up to the Segments table on synchronization. Segments are not supported for indicator sources or modules on domain-separated instances.


-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Yokohama Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   ****
-   **[Query Generation skills are active by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enable-query-generation&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If the Generative AI Controller plugin is activated, the skills for Query Generation are activated by default.

-   **[Greater visibility into the Query Generation process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ask-expl-questions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

When you call Query Generation from AI Data Explorer or another application, you see each state that the query and response goes through before completing.

-   **[Multi-table source support](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ask-expl-questions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Query Generation supports related table conditions and dot-walking in queries.

-   **[Get insights and visualizations for Workflow Data Fabric tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-integrations-applications&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ask AI Data Explorer information about Workflow Data Fabric data and get insightful responses. You must first add the Workflow Data Fabric tables to the Query Generation Semantic Table Configuration table.

-   **[Use database views in queries](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-table-semantic-layer&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate visualizations or ask AI Data Explorer about data kept in database views, like SLA data. You have to add the database views to the Semantic Table Configuration table.


-   **[Add tables to the semantic data layer](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-table-semantic-layer&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Choose which tables your users can query with generative AI for data analysis.

-   **[Monitor the health of the Query Generation back end](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=querygen-health-page&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
