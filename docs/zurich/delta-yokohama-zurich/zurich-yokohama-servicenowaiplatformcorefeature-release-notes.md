Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Enhance instance security for sandbox scripts with guarded script](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=guarded-script&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The guarded script evaluator restricts the JavaScript features and APIs available to untrusted, client-generated scripts running in the script sandbox environment. Beginning with the Yokohama Patch 13 release, incompatible scripts sent to the server by guest users are rejected on all instances by default. Scripts sent by authenticated users are evaluated using a phased approach to enforcement that varies by the type of instance to provide time to detect and review incompatible scripts before rejecting them. Scripts that use unsupported features are recorded in the Incompatible Guarded Scripts list, where you can rewrite them or create exemptions for scripts that can't be rewritten.

-   **[Add dynamic attributes to a dynamic category](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-dynamic-attributes-dynamic-category&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Add individual attributes or a group of attributes to a dynamic category.

-   **[Reference a dynamic attribute or a list of dynamic attributes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-dynamic-schema-reference&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Build a dependency between a dynamic attribute store field and either a dynamic attribute or a list of dynamic attributes.

-   **[Edit data in remote tables on an instance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-remote-table-script&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Insert, update, and delete data in an external data source from a remote table on an instance when you enable editing for the table. Customize the script definitions that enable you to insert, update, or delete data from a remote table.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Access and test pre-release features](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=feature-preview-program&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Feature Preview Program provides a centralized location to discover, activate, and test pre-release capabilities on your instance. When a pre-release feature is added to your instance, you receive a notification and can access the Feature Preview Program to review feature details, activate features for testing, and provide feedback.

-   **[Enhance instance security for sandbox scripts with guarded script](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=guarded-script&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The guarded script evaluator restricts the JavaScript features and APIs available to untrusted, client-generated scripts running in the script sandbox environment. Beginning with the Zurich Patch 9 release, incompatible scripts sent to the server by guest users are rejected on all instances by default. Scripts sent by authenticated users are evaluated using a phased approach to enforcement that varies by the type of instance to provide time to detect and review incompatible scripts before rejecting them. Scripts that use unsupported features are recorded in the Incompatible Guarded Scripts list, where you can rewrite them or create exemptions for scripts that can't be rewritten.

-   **[Hierarchical queries in condition builders](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-hierarchies&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify and build queries with fewer conditions using existing hierarchical data in a table. You can also define new hierarchical relationships between records that are in the same table.

-   **[Dynamic namespaces](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-dynamic-namespace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define categories and attributes once and reuse them using dynamic namespaces across multiple tables and dynamic attribute store fields. A dynamic namespace is automatically created when you add a dynamic attribute store field.

-   **[Experimentation framework](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=experimentation-framework&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help enable innovation by trying new ServiceNow® feature variants in your instance. Only single customer instances or Gen AI Innovation Program participants have early access to new innovations via experimentation framework. You can opt out of specific experiments or turn off the framework entirely.

-   **[Audit Management Console and audit retention](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=audit-mgmt-console&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify your audit data management and configuration by using the Audit Management Console module. It includes a new Retention option, which automates and simplifies the deletion of audit data based on your requirements.

-   **[Monitor requestors' API usage rates through the Inbound API Integration Usage dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=inbound-api-integration-usage-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Inbound integrations track web service requests for OAuth registered applications and user accounts making those requests.

-   **[Use schemas to define the structure and format of REST API responses and requests](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=define-scripted-rest-api-schema&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

When you define a schema in the ServiceNow AI Platform, the schema can be used to define the structure of requests and responses within the associated REST API. The schema data for the requests and responses is then available in the exportable OpenAPI specification for the API.

-   **[Automatically generate request definitions for scripted REST API resources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=autogenerate-api-request-definitions&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use sample requests made to an API resource to generate request header associations, query parameter associations, and a request schema for that resource and the related scripted REST API service.
