</td><td>

-   **[Now Assist based work notes analysis](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=worknotes-analysis&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Work notes analysis is now enhanced using Now Assist to understand the operational reasons behind activity transitions by examining the work notes and comments recorded around the time of these transitions.

-   **[Process configuration builder introduced](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-process-config&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure and view the process configurations efficiently by using the new comprehensive Process configuration builder. It is a guided setup to configure and view the process configurations.

-   **[Content pack importer introduced for process configurations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=po-content-pack&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Import and customize the content pack process configuration templates to activate new features. Content pack process configuration templates are now read-only.

-   **[Process Mining evaluation project available for HR and CSM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=evaluation-pm-inci-manag&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ability to try out the sample mining and limited features available for HR and CSM without an entitlement. For the advanced features, you can purchase a license.

-   **[Access control \(ACL\) rules updated](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=access-control&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The ACL rules have been updated for broader visibility on the try-out version while also increasing the security.

    -   No Process Mining role is required to access a shared project and to generate Platform Analytics insights for some tables.
    -   Some breakdown filters or activity definitions are blocked for certain users based on the column access.
-   **[Process Mining performance improved](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=analyst-workbench-overview&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following improvements boost Process Mining performance and lead to quicker insights:

    -   Introduced lazy loading of improvement opportunities and variants for faster workspace loading.
    -   Introduced applying a transition filter before mining to reduce scope of data and speed up the mining process.
    -   Improved Process Mining workbench load time.
-   **[Transition filters enhanced](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=node-to-node-conditions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The enhanced transition filters now provide more flexibility and precision in filtering the process map by providing the following:

    -   Ability to use `OR` clause on steps to create a more complex and nuanced criteria for process transitions.
    -   Include predicates like "is empty" and "is not empty" allowing for more refined control over the conditions under which transitions occur, ensuring that workflows are both comprehensive and adaptable to a variety of scenarios.
    -   Ability to select more than one value with a single click that contains a specific text.
-   **[Enhanced the Process Mining engine](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=set-activity-def&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Key updates include:

    -   Defining integer fields as activity definitions.
    -   Grouping journal fields to identify how quickly an agent reacted to an assigned case.
    -   Defining the order of simultaneous activities on the graph.
-   **[Addition﻿al breakdown capacity for Process Mining on external data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=external-dataset&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ability to import a maximum of 10 breakdown fields enabling to segment and analyze specific subsets of the external process data using Process Mining.

-   **[API for accessing Process Mining data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=define-workflow-model&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create, mine, and access Process Mining data via an API \(ProcessMiningIntegrationAPI\). For more information, see the API documentation.

-   **[Opportunity details page](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=opportunity-details&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate highlights to surface key drivers behind process patterns that accelerate decision-making and prioritization of process changes on the Opportunity details page. This page provides the detailed context of every improvement opportunity. It uses Now Assist to help generate highlights.

-   **[Idle time analysis](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=idle-time-analysis&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Analyze where cases are waiting to be assigned to agents by tracking and analyzing the time during which the case is assigned to a team but not yet to an agent. Idle time analysis helps identify inefficiencies, such as delays in task assignment or workflow bottlenecks, and helps improve coordination and reduce waiting time within processes. Idle time analysis must be configured in the process configuration.

-   **[Touchpoint analysis](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=touchpoint-analysis&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Identify where and how human involvement occurs in a process by using touchpoint analysis. Analyzing the fields that involves human involvement helps you improve your processes, enhancing performance and reducing operational costs. Touchpoint analysis enables you to analyze the workload of transitions and cases. Touchpoint analysis must be configured in the process configuration.

-   **[Enhanced data security](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=set-objectives&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Mark a project as restricted to help protect sensitive data and avoid security breaches. Restricted project data is available only to the owner and the users with whom the project is shared.

-   **[Share a Process Optimization project](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=share-project&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Share projects through a link that remains unchanged even when the project is updated and remined.

-   **[Creation of automation requests and CIMs simplified](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=submit-automation-idea&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

When creating an automation or Continual Improvement Management \(CIM\) request from Process Mining, mandatory fields are pre-populated, reducing friction and accelerating time-to-action.

-   **[Process Mining integrated with ServiceNow playbook](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=analyst-workbench-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Process Mining has been integrated with ServiceNow playbook. After analyzing and identifying a process for improvement, export the process to playbook and add subflows or triggers to analyze and refine the flow.

Use the Playbooks icon on the Process Mining Analyst Workbench to export up to 5 routes of a project to ServiceNow playbook. This feature is enabled by Now Assist.
