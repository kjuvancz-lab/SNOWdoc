    -   You can't edit the status report, but you can change the system property to enable editing.
    -   Import your old status reports to a new status report tool for a consistent and organized reporting system.
-   **[Duplicate a status report in Project Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=duplicate-status-report-pw&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Reduce effort by duplicating a status report to transfer all project information without manual copying.

-   **[Configuring security for a project in Project Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-security-for-a-project-in-pw&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Apply confidentiality settings to safeguard sensitive projects and make sure that only authorized users can access confidential data and sub-projects.
    -   When a project is marked confidential in one workspace, such as Project Management or Strategic Portfolio Workspace, these settings automatically extend across all associated workspaces, maintaining consistent protection.
    -   To promote security, at least one user must be assigned access to any confidential project.
-   **[Project task checklists](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_project-task-checklists&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Create a checklist for your project tasks and manage a list of activities or steps to be completed for a task.

-   **[Use Playbooks in Project Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-pw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Playbooks provide structured stages and activities to keep projects on track.
    -   Added two playbooks for Project Workspace: Project Default and Stage-gate Default.

-   **[Monitor and update project report status](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=duplicate-status-report-pw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Track the status of project reports using the Status drop down, and change the status from Draft to Published once updates are complete.

-   **[Copy and edit status report enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=update-status-report-project-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Simplified workflow for copying and editing status reports. Duplicate a status report directly without opening a form modal.
    -   The duplicated report automatically refreshes with the latest project updates \(for example, overall status, milestones, or metrics\).
    -   Any static or manually added data from the original report is retained in the duplicated version.
    -   When editing is disabled, all fields in the status report are read-only. When editing is enabled, only dynamic fields remain read-only. You can edit the status report in both the scenarios using the Edit Status Report action in the context menu.
-   **[Resource assignment updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-resource-mgmt-prj-wksp&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Access and modify resource details directly from the Resource page without having to navigate to Resource Management Workspace.
    -   End resource assignments when a project ends. View the resource assignments and synchronize the resource assignment dates with the project dates.
    -   Move resource assignments to a new start and end date to align with task dependencies or resource availability.
-   **[Status report properties](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-a-status-report-in-project-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   View only planned costs of your planning items to track the total cost of your projects.
    -   Use **Display mode** to switch between focused views to better plan and track the financials of your projects.
    -   Manage the planned and actual monetary benefit plans for your projects to identify the financial performance of your project using the Cost and benefits screen.
    -   Use multicurrency to view and manage financial records of the project in Investment currency, which can be different from your functional currency. Manage multiple financial records such as planned and actual expenses, planned and actual benefits, and so on.
