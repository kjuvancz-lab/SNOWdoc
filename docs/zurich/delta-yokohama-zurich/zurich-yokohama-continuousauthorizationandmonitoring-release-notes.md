Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[OSCAL Import landing page](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=import-oscal&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Import files for catalog and SSP models on the new OSCAL Import landing page. Once the import process is initiated, you can check the status under the Import status section.

-   **[OSCAL Export button](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=export-catalog-cam-ws&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Export selected control objectives in the OSCAL format with the new **OSCAL Export** button while in the control objectives list view.

-   **[ATO artifacts in Microsoft Word](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-ato-artifacts-cam-ws&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate ATO artifacts from an authorization package in the Microsoft Word format. In CAM Workspace, you can use the **Generate SSP** drop-down list in a selected authorization package to generate the following reports:

    -   Security Assessment Plan \(SAP\)
    -   Authorization to Operate \(ATO\) Letter
    -   Executive Summary
This enhancement verifies that all ATO artifacts are formatted consistently and can be shared and reviewed.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key cam-workflow-configurator\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cam-workflow-configurator&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline governance, risk, and compliance processes with the CAM Workflow Configuration. This feature allows administrators to:

    -   Create and manage multiple workflows within a package.
    -   Define GRC State Models for custom workflows.
    -   Configure and version workflows.
    -   Evaluate workflow version impacts to retrieve baseline controls.
    -   Set up workflow-specific approval configurations.
    -   Perform risk assessments across CAM objects.
    -   Migrate the NIST RMF flow to workflow configuration for improved standardization.
-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key add-child-boundary\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-child-boundary&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Introducing a new Child Boundaries list that enables a one-to-many boundary hierarchy, allowing you to create relationships between boundaries. This hierarchy is visualized in both the sidebar and diagram view, showing one parent boundary with multiple child boundaries. OSCAL export and import now include the parent boundary relationship if present.

-   **Dynamic Boundary Filters [Dynamic boundary filters](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-boundary-filter&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Select the **Dynamic Filter** option in boundary filters to update system elements according to filter conditions. When disabled, the system elements remain unchanged. This update enhances the flexibility of boundary filter management.

-   **[Boundary operational status automation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cam-form-authorization-boundary&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Linking boundary operational status to the package life cycle ensures seamless integration. Key changes include:

    -   Automatic update of boundary status to Operational when a package moves to the Monitor state.
    -   Transition of Boundary status to Reauthorize as the Package Authorization date approaches. This update maintains synchronization between package and boundary states, enhancing overall system coherence.
-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key export-oscal-files-from-authorization-package\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=export-oscal-files-from-authorization-package&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generating and downloading OSCAL SSP and POA&amp;M files is supported directly from within a authorization package. The supported file types include:

    -   Catalog
    -   Overlay Catalog
    -   Profile
    -   SSP
    -   POA&amp;M
-   **[OSCAL import enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=import-oscal&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhancing the OSCAL import experience, the OSCAL import playbook now allows you to:

    -   Import individual POA&amp;M JSON files.
    -   **User Mapping**: Automatically map users to existing ServiceNow users based on exact name matches, with the option to manually adjust mappings.
    -   **Group Mapping**: Automatically map groups to existing ServiceNow groups based on exact name matches, with the option to manually adjust mappings.
    -   **Roles and Responsibilities**: Populate relevant package fields with roles and responsibilities.
-   **[Overlay enhancement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=prepare-auth-pkg&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Apply policies as an overlay in an authorization package to determine how the control objectives in the policy impact the baseline. This can be done in the following ways:

    -   Addition: Create control objectives to address specific requirements not covered in the baseline.
    -   Subtraction: Move existing control objectives to **Not Applicable**.
    -   Customization: Create, move existing control objectives to not applicable, or skip control objectives.
-   **[OSCAL enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-cam-ws&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the OSCAL import playbook to follow a user-friendly, step-by-step approach for importing OSCAL models. Using the playbook, you can:

    -   Add multiple Catalog overlay files.
    -   Preview OSCAL data before importing them to confirm accuracy. You can preview the following:
        -   Authorization boundary
        -   Authorization package
        -   System elements
        -   Information types
        -   Baseline controls
        -   Inherited controls
        -   Hybrid controls
        -   Not applicable controls
        -   Policies
        -   Control objectives
        -   Control objectives requirements
    -   Skipped objects in the preview, such as control objectives, policies, authorization boundaries and packages can be individually overridden.
