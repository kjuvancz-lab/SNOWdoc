Keep record information in your documentation always current and reduce manual effort with the Dynamic data linking feature in Docs. You can now reference any ServiceNow application record and Docs will automatically reflect the latest updates from those records. For example, if you add a reference to a Project record, the reference will show the latest field information of the project in Docs without requiring manual edits. Clicking the project reference opens up the project form so that you can view the full details of the project record and make any necessary changes. Dynamic linking also enables adding references to a particular field of a record, such as Assigned to of an Incident record.

You can add references from any ServiceNow table you have access to, with no setup or configuration needed, thereby eliminate the hassle of switching between applications to copy and paste data from various records into Docs.

-   **[Quick filters enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=quick-fiters-prioitization-roadmap-ppw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Apply filters using string-type and Boolean field values across the Planning page to view the required dataset. These filters are saved as part of your user preferences, enabling you to access the same filtered data when you log back in and continue your planning seamlessly.

-   **[Financial enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-financials-pp&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   View only the planned costs of your planning items to track the total cost of projects or demands.
