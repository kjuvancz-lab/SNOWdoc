</td><td>

-   **[Business Portal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-business-portal&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Support your customers through the Business Portal self-service capabilities, such as knowledge articles, service catalogs, case management, Virtual Agent, and others. Help reduce maintenance effort through low-code configurations on pages with configurable widgets.

-   **[Email as an Interaction](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=email-channel&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhance case management with the Email as an Interaction feature.

    -   Transform emails into interactions, enabling customer communication to be tracked in a central location and help avoid unnecessary case creation.
    -   Manage straightforward customer inquiries via email, create cases for more complex issues, or link emails to existing cases.
    -   Notify agents on email responses received from customers.
-   **[Contact Center Integration Core](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=contactcenter-integration&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an admin, import data automatically from a third-party contact center as a service \(CCaaS\) application to facilitate external routing and third-party telephony integration in their ServiceNow® instance.

**Note:** The Contact Center Integration Core is a framework that includes voice call features, which doesn't work unless CCaaS implements it.

    -   Import records such as queues, skills, and wrap-up codes from a third party into your ServiceNow instance.
    -   Maintain data consistency between your ServiceNow instance and third-party systems. Verify that chats and cases are routed to the correct agent and that the correct wrap-up codes are available when dispositioning an interaction.
-   **[Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=contact-center-integration-with-icc&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an agent, manage calls, such as muting, holding, and transferring, directly within the Configurable Workspace. As a part of the new Voice interaction page experience, the ICC framework helps improve workflow efficiency and promotes a consistent agent experience across all channels.

**Note:** ICC must be integrated with your specific Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\) plugin to establish the telephony connection.

Connect customers with field agents or third-party support teams in the embedded call interface. Choose between the following transfer options:

    -   Consult transfer: Share the call context with the external contact before transferring the customer.
    -   Blind transfer: Immediately transfer the call to the external contact.
-   **[OpenFrame Integration to Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=interaction-controls-component&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

ICC is a new component for a native call controls interface embedded in Agent Workspace. With the ICC component, you can do the following:

    -   Create the state context in OpenFrame to read the state of idle and active call state, and the state of the transfer.
    -   Provide iframe sandbox parameters to allow iframe access to security features and to enable additional iframe restrictions.
    -   Create an extension point implementation to create and get phone log segments.
-   **[Integrating Conversational SMS with AWS End User Messaging](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=conversational-sms-integration-amazon&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Integrate the ServiceNow SMS channel with AWS end-user messaging to engage in conversations with Now Virtual Agent and live agents to address and resolve any customer queries or issues.

-   **[Amazon Connect for voice calls via ICC](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=amazon-connect-for-voice-calls&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage Amazon Connect calls directly in the CSM Configurable Workspace voice Interaction record page. This integration supports inbound and outbound call flows, presence management, and call transfers without switching applications.

-   **[Selecting queues for outbound calls](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=select-queues-for-outbound-calls&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable agents to designate a specific queue for their outbound calls directly from the keypad or the phone directory in the Global Call window to improve routing and reporting. This provides a streamlined search interface that enables agents to find and select a single queue that can be applied across all outbound dialing methods.

-   **[Integrating WhatsApp with Customer Service Management using the WhatsApp Cloud API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=messg-integrating-whatsapp-with-csm-whatsapp-cloud&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Connect directly to WhatsApp Cloud API for more reliable, feature-rich customer support without third-party dependencies. The key capabilities include the following:

    -   Send and receive text messages for direct customer communication.
    -   Exchange images, videos, audio files, and documents for clearer, more contextual conversations.
    -   Simplify customer input with list pickers and location sharing.
    -   View typing indicators for more natural conversational flow.
    -   Automatically capture and record customer opt-in and opt-out messages to ensure compliance with WhatsApp's messaging policies.
-   **[Defining CCaaS callbacks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=interaction-controls-component-icc-callback-integration-features&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Offer callers a callback option that lets them retain their position in the queue and receive a call when an agent is available. Alternatively, callers can choose a specific date and time for the callback, also known as scheduled callback.
    -   As an agent, view callback requests in the order that they're received.
-   **[CCaaS callback features](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=contact-center-intergration-with-icc-callback&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an agent, address callback requests from the CSM Configurable Workspace. Initiate callbacks and manage active calls with the Callback context card and Callback Actions component on the voice interaction page.

On the Callback actions component, you can use the **Call number** option to initiate a call; alternatively, the call can be initiated automatically at the end of the preview timer when enabled. After the call has ended, the **Close callback** option closes the callback interaction and changes the status to Closed complete. Agents can also retry the callback as needed.

Monitor the callback life cycle and capture the preview time that measures the time between when an agent accepts the callback request and the agent dials out the customer.

-   **[Global call list](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ccaas-global-call-list&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Switch between workspaces using the global call list. As a CSM agent, you can accept calls and open interaction records in supported, unsupported, or default workspaces.

-   **[Phone directory](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ccaas-phone-directory&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Access the embedded phone directory in your CSM Configurable Workspace via Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) to make outbound calls to external and internal contacts.

-   **[Call resiliency](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ccaas-call-resiliency&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Route phone calls to the CSM Configurable Workspace without creating an interaction record, helping agents handle calls even during connectivity issues.

-   **[Voice Controls Simulator tool](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=voice-control-simulator-tool&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Test and validate voice call UI flows in the CSM Configurable Workspace to ensure CCaaS partners have clear insights into their supported voice control capabilities.

-   **[Monitoring calls](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=call-monitoring&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable supervisors to monitor, coach, and barge-in on calls in real time by integrating ServiceNow's native voice call feature within an active call interface.

View or edit the interaction record while drafting an email in a modeless dialog, keeping all relevant information accessible.

-   **[Using Agent Chat](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ci-agent-chat-using&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Leave a chat without ending it for other agents, enabling you to complete your task and exit the chat.

-   **[CCaaS callback features](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=contact-center-intergration-with-icc-callback&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Callback management has been improved to make handling requests easier for agents. The key changes include:

    -   Equip agents to transfer the callback requests before dialing the call, enhancing flexibility in managing customer interactions.
    -   Enable scheduled callbacks, which help customers to choose a preferred callback time in addition to the existing ASAP option.
    -   Facilitate agents to view the list of queues and other agents for easier callback transfers and efficient customer management.
    -   Capture callback reasons more effectively with the expanded Reason for Call field, which includes additional choice values.
-   **[Unified routing of email interactions via CCaaS](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-email-interaction-customer-service-management&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Email interaction handling has been enhanced to improve efficiency and responsiveness in managing customer communications. The key changes include:

    -   Support external routing of email interactions.
    -   Enable agents to put email interactions on hold while waiting for customer responses.
    -   Notify CCaaS when an interaction is put on hold so that CCaaS can free up the agent's capacity for handling other interactions.
    -   Send automatic email reminders to customers for interactions that are on hold for a configurable period.
    -   Reroute email interactions to available agents when the originally assigned agent is unavailable.

-   **[Portal Data List widget](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=portal-data-list-widget&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Data List widget now offers more configuration flexibility and supports dynamic, context‑aware view selection. Key enhancements include:

    -   Role‑Based and Guest Views: Use the new role\_based\_views and guest\_view options to define different views for different user roles and for unauthenticated users removing the dependency on a single static view.
    -   Automatic URL Parameter Passing: Pass URL parameters automatically into scripts invoked from Data List instance options enabling admins to build richer, multi‑parameter conditions without extra setup.
    -   Script‑Based View Selection: Use the Data List Condition Script option to choose a view dynamically. Scripts can evaluate URL parameters and other context to determine the most appropriate view at runtime.
    -   Configurable Default Sorting: Define initial sorting behavior using the new sort\_by and sort\_order options letting the users see a meaningful default order when the list loads.
