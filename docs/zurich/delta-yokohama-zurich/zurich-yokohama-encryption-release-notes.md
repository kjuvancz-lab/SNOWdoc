For the GlideEncrypter API, NIST 800-131A Rev 2 has recommended against using the Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption. The following changes are taking place in the Zurich release with the official removal of 3DES encryption for GlideEncrypter.

-   The GlideEncrypter API defaults to using the Key Management Framework \(KMF\) based algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\), for encryption and decryption operations for upgraded instances only.
-   For instances created with the Zurich release or later, this API isn’t supported.
-   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

 In the Zurich release, Column Level Encryption has received a required upgrade to Key Management Framework Column Level Encryption \(KMF-CLE\) due to the platform-wide deprecation of 3DES. For more information about this upgrade, see KB1700704.
