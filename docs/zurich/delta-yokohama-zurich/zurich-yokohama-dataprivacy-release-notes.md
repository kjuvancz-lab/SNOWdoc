</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Full scan support added](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-data-discovery-jobs&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Data Discovery jobs support full type scans, which scan for sensitive data patterns in all the records. You can also use an incremental scan, which acts as a delta scan from the point of the last full scan.

-   **[XLS and CSV support added](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-discovery-attachment-scanning&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Data Discovery attachment scan type jobs now support XLS and CSV files. Attachment scans are incremental scans by default.

-   **[Text to Regex from a LLM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-data-discovery-patterns&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create a regex data pattern with the help of Now Assist, which supports all third-party LLMs approved by ServiceNow.


-   **Key word matching**

As part of key word matching when discovering sensitive data using regex, more precise data pattern matching has been implemented, using full strings of text. This may require customers to add more specific variants of keywords to achieve the same level of discovery precision as prior platform releases
