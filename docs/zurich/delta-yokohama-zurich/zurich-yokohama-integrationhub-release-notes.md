</td><td>

-   **[Stream Connect for Apache Kafka alerting](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-alert&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Get alerts for your Stream Connect integrations. Stream Connect uses both active and scheduled monitoring to detect events across multiple Stream Connect components. If an issue is detected, an alert is created, and a message is logged to the Stream Connect Log.
    -   Specify alert thresholds by configuring alerting properties. For example, you can specify a maximum amount of time to process the current message queue. If the estimated processing time exceeds your specified time, an alert is generated.
    -   Receive alert notifications via email, SMS, or the ServiceNow® mobile app. Notifications contain detailed alert information, including the alert number, level, and a description. You can configure notification settings based on alert types, severity, and user preferences.
-   **[View producer statistics in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get detailed information about Stream Connect producers and their performance, including a producer’s status and type, the number of bytes and messages produced to a topic, and producer data trends over time, in the Stream Connect dashboard.

-   **[Check data usage in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

View total data usage and data usage per month and topic with the Stream Connect dashboard. Data usage history is available for the last 12 complete months plus the current month.

-   **[Use error evaluation with Data Stream actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-stream-actions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Catch step errors and specify error behavior for each step in a Data Stream action. Create your own error conditions by specifying when an action returns an error state and the status codes and messages they return.

-   **[View connection aliases in integration actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-connections-integration-hub&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Edit, configure, and create connection aliases in the Action Properties section of actions in ServiceNow® Workflow Studio. View connection error details for connection aliases that are not set up or configured.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Generate the parsing phase for REST-based Data Stream actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-stream-actions&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Automatically configure the splitter step, script parser step, and outputs for REST-based Data Stream actions. The **Test REST step** functionality in REST-based Data Stream actions executes a request to the configured REST endpoint, analyzes the response payload, and automatically sets up the parsing and output components.

-   **[Stream Connect enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-apache-kafka&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Use a MID Server cluster, instead of a single MID Server for [message replication](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-message-replication&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). With a MID Server cluster, if one of the MID Servers fails, the other MID Servers can share the load of the failed MID Server.
    -   In the [Kafka subscription record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=kafka-subscriptions-statistics&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US), view the estimated time required for a consumer to process the current queue. The subscription record also links to the consumer record, so that you can see which consumer is processing the queue.
    -   Specify a compression format for Stream Connect producers with the **com.glide.kafka\_producer.compression\_type** system property. Stream Connect supports the GZIP and LZ4 compression formats.
-   **[View alerts in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get detailed information about alerts, including their severity level, state, type, and the affected entity in the Stream Connect dashboard.

-   **[Test connection aliases directly from configuration templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=test-alias-configuration-template&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

For aliases using a configuration template, you can configure a Test Action field. This field enables you to test a connection from within the Action Properties section of actions in Workflow Studio.

-   **[Support for PowerShell version 6.0 or later in the PowerShell step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=powershell-step-action-designer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable the PowerShell step to use a newer version of PowerShell by adding the MID Server property **mid.property.ihub.prefer\_powershell6Plus** and setting it to `true`.

-   **[Use WS-Security in a SOAP step on a MID Server](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=soap-step-action-designer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable a WS-Security policy in a SOAP step running on a MID Server.

-   **[Delay parallel loading in custom \(load by script\) data sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=custom-type-data-source&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure a delay for parallel loading in custom data sources. When the data source is called, the parallel loading is scheduled to run after the configured amount of time.

-   **Spoke-specific AI agents**

AI agents that implement different agentic workflows are available for various spokes. Use these spoke-specific AI agents to execute agentic workflows.

-   **[Save draft, publish, update external trigger definition, and support domain separation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-saved-external-trigger&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The external trigger definition is updated to match the trigger builder so that the external trigger definition supports the saving of draft, publishing, updating external trigger definition, and supporting domain separation.

-   **[Create and manage external event sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-external-event-sources&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define and manage custom trigger definitions after creating external event sources.
