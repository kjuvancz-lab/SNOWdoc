# Combined ITOM Visibility release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Zurich

Consolidated page of all release notes for ITOM Visibility from Yokohama to Zurich.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family ITOM Visibility release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Zurich.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading ITOM Visibility to Zurich

Before you upgrade to Zurich, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

3DES support is planned for permanent removal from the MID Server for MID Servers with SSH-based Discovery or SSH-based integrations. For more information, see [3DES deprecation in SSH from Xanadu \[KB1644950\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1644950).

 After upgrading to Yokohama, a Fix Script named "Add Explicit Public SNMP Credential" might create a public SNMP credential in Production instances. This could lead to unnecessary records via Discovery. The Fix Script is present in Yokohama instances, including OOB. Before applying the upgrade of Discovery core, Yokohama version, verify the fix script behavior in a sandbox environment. Remove the public SNMP credentials if not required.

-   **[Benefit from an updated, curated selection of application service candidates in Service Mapping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sm-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have ITOM Content Service installed, you can view an enhanced selection of Application Service Candidates \(ASCs\) that provides more accurate and useful information, with an automatic filter applied to hide irrelevant and non-essential components.

-   **[Automate your certificate workflows using Keyfactor EJBCA and ACME](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automate-certificates-ejbca-acme&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version XX of Certificate Inventory and Management, you can automate the life cycle of requesting, renewing, and revoking your certificates by integrating the Keyfactor EJBCA certificate authority with the ACME automated certificate management environment. Predefining your routing policies enables automated completion of the fields in your Certificate Signing Request \(CSR\) and provides a secure environment for an automated flow of certificates.

-   **[Discover a Root Certificate from a Browser](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discover-root-certificate-browser&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Standard Discovery collects information about the certificates stored in your servers. You can also discover root certificates stored outside your servers and connect them to your certificate chain.

-   **[Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acc-kubernetes-visibility-landing-page&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

KVA performs continuous discovery to detect changes on resources in a Kubernetes cluster and updates the CMDB with the latest data.

Starting with KVA version 3.11.0, and Informer version 2.5.0, absent namespace CIs aren’t deleted automatically. Create a scheduled job to remove them.

Starting with KVA version 3.11.0, and Informer version 2.5.0, map application services based on traffic connections between the workloads in Kubernetes, by using istio and linked service meshes or the DaemonSet service.

-   **[Prevent credential exposure by updating HTTP Classify behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-an-http-classifier&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The HTTP Classify probe no longer attempts credentials over the HTTP protocol by default. This change enhances security by helping prevent potential exposure of credentials over unencrypted connections. To override this behavior, a new MID Server property, **mid.http\_classy.allow\_credentials\_over\_http**, has been introduced. Enabling this setting might expose credentials to man-in-the-middle \(MitM\) attacks. Therefore, it’s strongly recommended to keep this property set to false and use HTTPS whenever possible.

-   **[Automated certificate renewal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automated-certificate-renewal&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version 3.8.2, Certificate Inventory and Management introduces automated renewal capabilities. Administrators can set certificates to renew automatically, either when creating the certificate or by applying the setting to an existing one. The system also enables you to define the renewal window by specifying the number of days before expiration that the process should begin.
